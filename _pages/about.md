## 👋 Hello, I’m Rashid

### Applied AI & Data Science | Speech Analytics | Decision-Ready Insights

I am an **Applied AI and Data Science professional** with strong foundations in machine learning, data engineering, and speech analytics. I design and build **production-leaning AI systems end-to-end**—from raw data ingestion and modelling to evaluation and decision-ready outputs used by stakeholders.

My work focuses on translating ambiguous business problems into **measurable ML solutions** that scale beyond notebooks. I have built and shipped applied AI systems across **speech-to-text pipelines, sentiment intelligence, analytics automation, and dashboard-driven decision support**, particularly in insurance and customer operations environments.

## 🔍 What I Focus On

- **Applied NLP & Speech Analytics**  
  Automatic speech recognition (ASR), speaker diarisation, summarisation, and sentiment intelligence for contact-centre and operational use cases.

- **Production-Ready Machine Learning**  
  Models designed with evaluation, robustness, and deployment constraints in mind—not just accuracy scores.

- **Analytics Automation & Insight Delivery**  
  Turning complex data into stakeholder-ready dashboards, triage signals, and prioritisation frameworks.

---

## 🚀 How I Work

I combine **engineering discipline** with an **evaluation-first mindset**:
- Clear problem framing  
- Strong baselines and metrics  
- Iterative experimentation  
- Outputs that support real decisions, not vanity metrics  

My approach is pragmatic, impact-driven, and grounded in real operational constraints.

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

I am actively exploring opportunities as an:

- **Applied AI Engineer**
- **Data Scientist**
- **Machine Learning Engineer**
- **Speech / NLP Analytics Specialist**

particularly in teams building **real-world AI systems**, not just research prototypes.
